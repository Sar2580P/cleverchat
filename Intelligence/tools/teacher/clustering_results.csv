Type-2 diabetes is primarily a lifestyle disorder, one that gets worse with the increase of insulin resistance in the body.

If you are diagnosed with diabetes, be assured that your doctor’s first aim is to reduce or prevent the impacts of insulin resistance in the body. Indulging in physical activities like yoga and exercising improves the body’s insulin sensitivity, thereby improving the cell’s efficacy to metabolize blood glucose into energy.
Hence, yoga asanas for diabetes management aren’t folklore but a scientifically proven fact that can help you get into remission and better manage the symptoms."

86,11,86,"Take 1 small cup of low-fat yogurt with 1 cup of berries. Berries are excellent antioxidants and a great source of fiber. It slows down the digestion process and thus helps in the stabilization of sugar levels. Yogurt contains probiotics that improve body metabolism and thus enhance food absorption. In this way, it regulates blood sugar levels. It is also a rich source of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium.
1 small apple with 25 grams of peanut butter."
87,11,87,"1 small apple with 25 grams of peanut butter.

Apple is a low-glycemic fruit that contains polyphenols. Polyphenols slow down sugar absorption into the bloodstream after digestion of food. Thus, a rapid increase in blood sugar levels is prevented. Peanut butter, on the other hand, is a rich source of healthy fats, a good amount of fiber, and proteins. All of which are needed to help in regulating blood sugar absorption."
88,-1,88,"Green beans are low glycemic index foods that contain high vitamins A, C, K, iron, chlorophyll, fiber, and folic acid. All these are vital nutrients for our body and help in regulating blood sugar levels [5]."

Diabetes brings along a lot of other issues like Insomnia, acidity, irregular blood pressure, tingling sensation in hands and feet, etc. Diabetes can be a hereditary or lifestyle-borne condition. In this condition, blood sugar levels are extremely high from the standard levels of fasting blood sugar. Since it is chronic (lifelong), a person should consume his or her medicines to keep their blood glucose under control. However, one can exercise certain effective home remedies to keep their sugar levels in check."
93,-1,93,"Count on the carbs and opt for foods with a low glycemic index: Monitoring of overall carb consumption is important. Many people are unable to monitor their diet for various reasons, which makes it difficult for them to regularize their sugar levels.

Constant push and motivation, regular follow-ups, 24X7 reach, weekly challenges, and report cards have helped 10000+ patients reverse their diabetes.
- Drink a sufficient amount of water and keep the body hydrated: Drinking water keeps blood sugar levels within healthy limits. Also, helps the kidneys wash down the excess sugar via urine.
- Be physically active: Exercise enhances insulin sensitivity and thus, reduces sugar levels. Fitness Coach plans a workout routine, which suits your body and can be done both at home or office.
- Increase the consumption of fibers: Fiber helps to delay the processes of carbohydrate digestion and sugar absorption. Thus, fiber raises sugar levels gradually.
- Manage stress levels by adopting good habits like exercise, meditation, or yoga: These help diabetic patients regulate their blood sugar levels. One should never be hesitant to take help from a therapist or psychologist in case of high stress or depression. 1000s of people are off depression medication after joining the Diabetes Reversal Program.
- Lastly, good and sound sleep helps in keeping glucose levels in check: Also, sleep helps in maintaining a healthy weight. And poor sleep can disturb the crucial metabolic hormones. Insomnia can be treated naturally by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
